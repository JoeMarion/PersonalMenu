# Menu Maker

Menu Maker started out as a hackathon project make grocery shopping more efficient. Making grocery lists is fairly common, especially if the list is categorized. Menu Maker allows you to save or create meals to your profile that can be added to your current grocery list. After you select your meals you want to purchase, generate your list and the ingredients will be organized by category. This will make going to the grocery store a breeze, especially because your meals are saved for future lists to make.

## History

My family are enthusiastic "list-makers" especially when it came to grocery shopping. Prior to going to the store we would create about a weeks worth of meals that we would want to shop for. After coming up with the meals we would go back and right down all the ingredients for each meal, and when that was done we would create a final list to refactor the ingredients into one master list that was organized by grocery section. Making the list took a substantial amount of time, but it made the actual act of shopping very quick. This idea sprouted because we have trouble remembering what meals we know how to make, making decisions for which meal to make difficult, and the amount of time it would take to create the list. Having an account that remembers all the meals we have made in the past would make it much easier to browse what meals we have to choose from, and this cuts down on the time it takes to make a list significantly.
